Future Development:

1. This is not currenlty backed by a live Database, but if this tool were deployed with a real purpose, I would like for a proxy server to be set up to take in new information. 
2. To supplement the connection to a database, I would like to provide functionality to edit the Employee information inside the database. 
3. Add user control.
